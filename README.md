# Google Clone

Hey everyone 👋 I’m super excited 😍 to share with you my latest project: a Google clone built with React and Material UI!

This project was a great way to practice my React skills 💻 and learn how to use the Google Custom Search API and the Context API. I also used Firebase for hosting and authentication 🔥

You can check out the live demo here: https://clone-goo-gle.web.app/ 🚀

Please note that this is just a personal project for learning purposes and not a real search engine 🙈

Also, it is best viewed on a desktop browser as it is not fully responsive yet 🖥️

I hope you like it and feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions 🙏

Thanks for your support! ❤️
